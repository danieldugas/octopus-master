Pre-release notes:

Expected behaviour - 
select text, assign to register. Text stays highlighted (see :h signs),
cursor is free to move. Once multiple selections are made, 
Octopus can manipulate them.
if called from normal mode, each tentacle acts like a collection of cursors
if called from visual mode, each tentacle acts like " " of selections


Options

g:OctopusHighlightPriority  default = -1

negative value means that Tentacle highlighting will be hidden behind
search or visual highlighting (see :h matchadd )

CURENT WORK:

- avoid creating several cursors in the same location ( Tentacle.moveCursorToLastSucker ) x
- create sucker.updateContent() function x
- when activating a tentacle, current mode is new tentacle mode or old mode? option?
- deal with virtual lines (folds)
- deal with tentacle overlap
- suckers as a table in tentacle. 
  for i in range(1, tentacle.suckers) -> for currentsucker in tentacle.suckers
